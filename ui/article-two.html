            <p>O woman, you are not merely the
                handiwork of God, but also of men;
                these are ever endowing you with
                beauty from their hearts.
               </p>

            <p>Poets are weaving for you a web
                with threads of golden imagery;
                painters are giving your form ever
                new immortality.
            </p>

            <p>
            The sea gives its pearls, the mines
            their gold, the summer gardens their
            flowers to deck you, to cover you, to
            make you more precious.</p>
        
            <p>The desire of men's hearts has shed
                its glory over your youth.
                You are one half woman and one
                half dream. </p>
