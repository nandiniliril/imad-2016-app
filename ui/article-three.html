                  What do you sell, 0 ye merchants?

Richly your wares are displayed,

Turbans of crimson and silver, 

Tunics of purple brocade,

Mirrors with panels of amber, 

Daggers with handles of jade. </p>


<p>What do you weigh, 0 ye vendors?

Saffron and lentil and rice.

What do you grind, 0 ye maidens? 

Sandalwood, henna and spice. 

What do you call, 0 ye pedlars? 

Chessmen and ivory dice. </p>


<p>What do you make, 0 ye goldsmiths?

Wristlet and anklet and ring, 

Bells for the feet of blue pigeons, 

Frail as a dragon-fly's wing, 

Girdles of gold for the dancers,

Scabbards of gold for the king. </p>


<p>What do you cry, 0 ye fruitmen? 

Citron, pomegranate and plum. 

What do you play, 0 musicians? 

Cithar, sarangi and drum. 

What do you chant, 0 magicians? 

Spells for the aeons to come. </p>


<p>What do you weave, 0 ye flower-girls?

With tassels of azure and red? 

Crowns for the brow of a bridegroom, 

Chaplets to garland his bed, 

Sheets of white blossoms new-gathered 

To perfume the sleep of the dead.
