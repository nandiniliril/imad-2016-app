                    <p>I am mother nature 
                        Which creates and destroys a creature
                        It took me a long while 
                        To better the way you live. 
                        Since you have turned hostile, 
                        I've got no more to give. </p>
        
                    <p>My land is filled with waste 
                        My children are displaced. 
                        They live in utter fear, 
                        Watching friends disappear. </p>
        
                    <p>I have become man-made, 
                        Who serves you like a maid. 
                        Unnatural and impure, 
                        A disease with no cure.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>  My children, I love you. 
                         I hope you love me too. 
                        Your mother needs you now. 
                        Help me I'll show you how.  
                    </p>
        
                    <p>Recycle and conserve, 
                        Heed the rights I deserve. 
                        Hear my weakening voice, 
                        Help me regain my poise.  
                    </p>
        
                    <p>My gifts you must protect: 
                        From air to ocean shelf. 
                        My love you should respect 
                        Save me to save yourself.
                    </p>
